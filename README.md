# Modelling of a Whelchair on two Wheels

I am studying ways to improve the quality of disabled people through the improvement of hybrid wheelchair.

The first step is to determine the physics parameters. Therefore, I developed the following functions:

 * Calculation of Moment of Inertia: Contains experiment and algorithms to calculate the moment of inertia.
 * Wheelie Simulation: Contains files to simulate the wheelie task of wheelchair from the optimization of optical control.
 * Torque curve: Contains the function to determine the minimum torque to start the wheelie task.

I have been working since last year. Therefore, I still have some code done to add in this repository. I will update it as soon I can.
