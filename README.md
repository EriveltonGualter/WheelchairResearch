# Modelling of a Whelchair on two Wheels

I am studying ways to improve the quality of disabled people through the improvement of hybrid wheelchair.

The first step is to determine the physics parameters. Therefore, I developed the following functions:

 * Function "parameters.m": Return the moment of inertia and vector of center of mass and center of the rear axle.
 * General parameters for the wheelchair used. 

I have been working since last year. Therefore, I still have some code done to add in this repository. I will update it as soon I can.
